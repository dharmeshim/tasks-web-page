# tasks-web-page
This project is a simple Todo List web page that allows users to add tasks, check off completed tasks, and delete tasks from the list. The webpage is created using HTML and CSS code, and uses JavaScript to dynamically update the list and add functionality to the add and delete buttons. The webpage includes a text input field for adding new tasks, a button to add the task to the list, and a checkbox next to each task on the list. The task list also changes dynamically to display completed and pending tasks. The user can click on the checkbox to mark a task as completed, which will add a line-through on the task text and change its background color. Also, the user can click on the "x" button next to each task to delete it from the list.
